*Status: Alpha* Salmon makes heavy use of [donut.system](https://github.com/donut-party/system), which is in alpha status. donut.system states that the interfaces may change, but change is unlikely.

Salmon is a library for building AWS architectures in the REPL, and then deploying them in CI/CD environments.
